## 🤷‍♀️ Question Time

### 👨‍🔬 What is this and what was this built for?

Welf DAO was built for the purpose of improving the transparency , trust and the crediblity among the users with fundraising for Welfare means. If you wanna help people or support or cause by donating , at the same time also getting incentivized for what you do , you are on the right platform. Welf DAO is completly controlled based on DAO Governance based system , completly removing middle party platforms and their exposure

## 🤔 Why Welf?

Transparency has been the biggest issue for all the people donating on other platforms , we are quite worried about who will get the money , how it will be used , where it will go , or even the person creating is trustworthy. Moreover there is no incentive involved in this process for both helpers & even the donors , Welf through a proper incentive mechanism , incentives them both
